#50 Contextualization of the architecture deliverable 

1. Introduction

1.1.Key Business Objectives:
-Accelerate DLT solutions market uptake in Portugal.
-Develop innovative new blockchain-based products and services across various sectors (agriculture, healthcare, sustainability, sports and gaming, Loyalty systems, DaaS, and Interoperability).
-Combine public funding with private investments to secure project sustainability.
-Facilitate global market presence for participating companies.
-Launch 26 innovative products worldwide.

1.2.Value Proposition:
-This project seeks to unlock the transformative potential of blockchain technology within Portugal's economy and society.
-By developing interoperable and user-friendly solutions, the project aims to boost adoption across diverse industries, while establishing a robust governance model to ensure project success.
-Public-private partnerships and a focus on innovation ensure the creation of commercially viable and impactful solutions.
-Global market expansion creates opportunities for Portuguese companies and strengthens the national blockchain ecosystem.


2. Architectural Requirements
This project is establishing a robust governance model to ensure project success.Key elements of the governance model include:

-Steering Committee: Sets the overall strategic direction.
-Advisory Board: Provides expert guidance and advice.
-Executive Committee: Manages day-to-day operations.
-Scientific Board: Leads research and development activities.
-Quality, Ethics & Privacy Board: Ensures compliance and ethical practices.
-Financial Coordinator: Oversees financial management.
-Innovation Manager: Identifies and promotes impactful innovations.
-Dissemination Officer: Ensures project awareness and knowledge sharing.
-WP Leaders: Drive individual work packages within the project.

The governance model defines the decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities involved in project execution.To ensure project success, the architecture must comply with these governance structures.
Therefore, architectural requirements should include:

-Transparency and accountability:
.The system should enable transparent data access and reporting for relevant stakeholders.
.Audit trails and logging mechanisms should support accountability within the governance structure.
-Risk management:
.The architecture should incorporate mechanisms to identify, assess, and mitigate project risks as defined by the governance model.
-Interoperability:
.Seamless communication and data exchange between diverse blockchain platforms and solutions.
.Support for multiple types of interoperability (technical, semantic, organizational, legal).
.Standardized APIs and protocols to facilitate integration.
-Scalability and Performance:
.Ability to handle increasing transaction volumes and user base without compromising performance.
.Efficient resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.
-Security and Privacy:
.Robust security measures to protect user data and assets.
.Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations.
.User-centric controls and transparency regarding data usage.
-Regulatory Compliance:
.The system should facilitate communication and collaboration between different governance bodies (e.g., steering committee, executive committee).
.Access control mechanisms should align with defined roles and permissions.
Architecture aligns with existing and evolving blockchain regulations in Portugal and the EU.
.Ability to adapt to changing regulatory landscape.
-Sustainability:
.Energy-efficient solutions that minimize environmental impact.
.Long-term maintainability and upgradeability of the architecture.

3. System Overview
The governance model outlines the overall project structure and decision-making flow. The system overview should reflect this structure by presenting the key components and how they interact within the governance framework.

3.1.High-Level Components:

-Interoperability Layer: Responsible for enabling communication and data exchange between various systems and components.
-Product and Service Layers: Comprise the individual blockchain-based solutions developed within each vertical work package (WP) and other specific tasks like the Portuguese Digital Wallet.
-Regulatory Sandbox: Provides a testing environment for innovative blockchain solutions while ensuring regulatory compliance.
-Governance and Monitoring Layer: Oversees the overall system operation, ensures data security, and facilitates collaboration among stakeholders.
-Cacti Business Model Platform: A centralized platform leveraging the Cacti model to manage access, usage, and monetization of the interoperable blockchain solutions built within the project.


Suggestion: We can consider adding a simple diagram illustrating the interactions between these components for better visualization.
Question: Should we Focus on explaining Cacti integration specifically for each pilot, showcasing how it addresses their interoperability and potential revenue generation concerns?
